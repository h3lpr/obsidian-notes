# Natural Numbers

The numbers used for counting or enumerating items. Also known as the counting numbers.
ex. {1,2,3,...}

# Whole Numbers

The set of whole numbers is the set of natural numbers plus zero.
ex {0,1,2,3,...}

# Integers

The set of integers adds the opposites of the natural numbers to the set of whole numbers.
ex {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

# Rational Numbers

{$\frac{m}{n}\vert$ m and n are integers and $n\neq 0$}

Rational numbers are fractions (or quotients) containing integers in both the numerator and denominator, and the denominator can never be zero. Every natural, whole number, and integer is a rational number with a denominator of 1.

Because they are fractions, any rational number can also be expressed as a terminating or repeating decimal.
- a terminating decimal: $\frac{15}{8}=1.875$, or
- a repeating decimal: $\frac{4}{11}=0.36363636...=\overline{0.36}$
